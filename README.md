# GreyScale_Image_Processor

## Description:
Hello, Welcome to simple greyscale Image processer. Using this image processer, you can simply apply fully blur(or/and))sharpened blur(or/and)find edges to your greyscaled image using MATLAB. Add a grey Scaled Image of extension ".pgm"

## Setting up the Code:
- The "GreyScale_Image_Processor" folder has six files of which
the matlab_file_io_pavan has the main code for the program to run.
- An example is greyscale image is provide with the name "GreyScaleImage.pgm" for the user.
- The images that were generated after the running the code is also included with names: blurred5andsharpen.pgm,blurred5times.pgm,edgedetection.pgm.

## Run the Code:
-On the Editor or Live Editor tab, in the Run section, click  Run.
-Upload the image for processing (If not available: Please choose the "GreyScaleImage.pgm" image form the folder)
-Choose the level of blur(or/and))sharpened blur(or/and)find edges to the image from 0 to 5. where,0 represents the no modification and 5 represents the highest modification.
-Image processsing tool generates the processed image in comparision with the origional image.
-Inorder to save in the current folder the processed image please click "y" indicating yes

## Version Requirements:
